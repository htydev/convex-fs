## Example

The best way to test your bunny.net integration is ready and to learn how to
integrate ConvexFS into your own app is by getting the example app running
first.

## Clone the repo

If you haven't already, clone the `convex-fs` repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jamwt/convex-fs
```

## Get the app install and running

Launch the app in the normal Convex way:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

The `run dev` command will run both the frontend, and the `npx convex dev`
command in the background.

This command will make sure you're logged in, help you set up a new Convex
project, etc.

## Set the bunny.net environment variables.

Your app is running, but it doesn't work—yet! We need to introduce those
variables and keys from [the bunny.net setup](/get-started/setup-bunny) into our
Convex backend.

If your Convex project dashboard isn't already loaded, you can pop it up at any
time from the CLI in your project root:

```bash
$ npx convex dashboard
```

Then, click **Settings** in the left nav, and choose **Environment Variables**.
Finally, set those four variables from the CDN setup using the management UI:

![dashboard env vars](./bunny-convex-dashboard.png)

## Try the app!

Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and drag and drop
some images! You should see them upload and then populate into your file view.
You can try renaming, copying, and deleting your image files.

It should look a little like this:
